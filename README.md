# Swipe Coding Challenge

## Problem Statement

Develop a simple invoice management system using React and Redux. Your objective is to store the created invoices in Redux, display a list of these invoices, and provide options to view, edit, and delete them by creating Redux actions, action types and reducers.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server


## Requirements

1. Create a React application using create-react-app.
2. Create Invoice component to create a new invoice.
3. Integrate Redux into the application and create a Redux store.
4. Create Redux actions, action types, and reducers to manage the invoice state (add, edit, view,
and delete invoices).
5. Implement a component to display a list of invoices.
6. Make list of invoices as first screen and move the create to a new create invoice button
7. In the invoice list, add buttons or options for view, edit, and delete operations.
8. Ensure proper state management throughout the application by connecting components to the
Redux store.
9. Make sure the application handles errors gracefully.
10. Write clean, well-documented, and modular code.
11. Implement copy to a new invoice from existing invoice functionality.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Functionality: The application should meet all the requirements and work correctly without errors.
2. UI/UX: The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface, with a responsive design that works on different screen sizes.
3. Code Quality: The code should be well-organized, modular, and follow React best practices.
4. Documentation: The README.md file should be clear and comprehensive, providing all the
necessary information to understand, install, and run the project.
5. Bonus Points: You can earn bonus points for adding extra features to the application, such as a search bar, sorting, filtering, etc.
